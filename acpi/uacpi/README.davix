	Davix usage of uACPI

uACPI is a large portion of an ACPI subsystem (similar to ACPICA, but
objectively better) that is shared between many operating systems.  As of
2025-01-24, the uACPI project lives at https://github.com/uACPI/uACPI,
which is where authoritative code for uACPI exists.

Everything in this directory, except for the GNUmakefile in uacpi/ and
in uacpi/source is uACPI source code that has not intentionally been
modified in any way.

Current uACPI commit: 63ab369748db5764b59a728f54da0d7e5390f407

	Keeping uACPI sources up-to-date

Because we don't use git submodules for this, uACPI sources need to be
kept up-to-date manually.  The process for this boils down to:

- git checkout the latest-and-greates uACPI in another source directory.

- copy the uACPI source files to this directory.

- keep the GNUmakefiles accurate.

- update the current commit in this file.
